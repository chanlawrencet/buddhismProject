          This standing buddha, found in the Mogao Caves, is made from wood. Unfortunately, because of time, the small sculpture standing on a little pedestal has lost much of its detail. Lines on the figurine are soft and edges are generally more rounded. The Buddha stands on a small hourglass-shaped pedestal, and is donning a robe.

            <p class="indent">
            Buddha’s expression cannot be judged, since his mouth has worn away, but the prayer position of his hands suggests that his expression would be neutral. His hands, conjoined in front of his torso, both point upwards towards the sky. The presence of shoes is unknown, and he is also either wearing a headdress or has his hair in a bun. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
              The wooden material of the sculpture suggests it to be have crafted with a lower production cost. The inexpensive nature of the sculpture is further supported by the lack of defined details on the wood, thought that may be a result of weathering. In addition to its rough appearance, the statue is of small size, allowing it to be portable. As such, the object may have belonged to travelers, perhaps monks or lay practitioners. It might then suggest that pilgrimage played a part in Tang Buddhism.
